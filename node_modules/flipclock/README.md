All files are compiled with Gulp. Once you are in the FlipClock directory, run the command `npm install` followed by the command `gulp dev` which will compile all source. Additionally, BrowserSync will launch a directory of all examples. Editing anything in the examples or src directory will cause the browser to automatically reload or inject style changes.
